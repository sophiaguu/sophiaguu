- 👋 Hi, I’m @sophiaguu
- 👀 I’m interested in pharmacology and statistics. 
- 🌱 I’m currently in my last year at UBC. I've learned about research and development at the biotech company STEMCELL Technologies, clinical research during my co-op at BCCHR, as well as all things bioinformatics in this Github at Djavad Mowafaghian Centre for Brain Health.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything!
